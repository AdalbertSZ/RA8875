RA8875
======

A Fast and Optimized library for RAiO RA8875 display driver for Teensy 3.x and Arduino's (and I hope for other MCU's).
This is the first attemp to create a library that use all the features of this chip and I'm tring to optimize as much I can.
Actually it's in alpha stage, working but only SPI (4 wires), please read the notes in .h file.
I provide a lot of examples, coming soon...
Please note that there's some remaining code from the Adafruit_RA8875 that I've use to test some basic functionalities but it's 100%
stealed from the RAiO application note so in that case it's quite difficult talk about copyrights!
As always, thanks to Lady Ada and his team to provide some code for developers, a good start point!

This library will work with the Adafruit board but was made expecially for the many tft on china market that use this chip, some are quite good and cheap, like
the EastRising at buydisplay.com, well made and much cheaper than adafruit.

Please wait a beta release, I'm still fighting with the code....
